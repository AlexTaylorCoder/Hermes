    <h3> Project Overview </h3>
    <p>
        This project was created to be a live chat application, with the final goal of becoming a Discord or Slack-like application.
        Similar to Discord or Slack, Hermes has a channel system in which different users can communicate through different channels.
        There is also an invite system so only invited users can chat in private channels. Additionally, different profiles can be created
        for aech channel you are a part of. You are a unique "member" of a channel you join but you still have a high-level user attached
        to your account. Text channels incorporate a rich-text editor to send dynamically styled text.This project was created over the span over a week in the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp with the help of Celestino Martinez.

    <h3> Additional Goals </h3>
    <p>
        The first would be incorporating Rails Action Cable into the project, to fully flush out the "live" features of the application.
        Second is incorporating Rails Active Storage to locally store user profile pictures and other media.
        Next would be a way to browse channels and request access to join; currently channels are invite only.
        Lastly, incorpoting message history and additional role and administration features would round of the project
